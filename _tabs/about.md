## About Me

### The Journey
My passion for technology began in 8th grade. I was in the computer lab discovering **Q-Basic**, which sparked a lifelong love for programming. My curiosity quickly expanded to **Python, Java, C++, and Linux (Ubuntu)**, giving me a deep understanding of how different systems operate.

University channeled this passion into **Cybersecurity**. Inspired by *Mr. Robot* and fueled by curiosity, I immersed myself in BASH scripting, Kali Linux, and the "Red vs. Blue" dynamic of offensive and defensive security.

As I expanded my knowledge, I discovered the importance of **networking** and **data analysis**. I delved into **network protocols**, **firewalls**, and **intrusion detection systems**, gaining a comprehensive understanding of how networks function and how to secure them.

Now, while I am working at my current job, I continue to learn and grow in the field of cybersecurity. I am always seeking new challenges and opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills.
