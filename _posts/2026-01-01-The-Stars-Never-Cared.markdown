The biggest lie we ever told each other was that we were in control.
Within ocean of hopelessness, winds of chance lead us towards the nothingness.
Moments of belief sculpt a stranger's face.
Radiating a gravity that pulls in the fallen masquerading as hope.
The stars will shine brighter than they have ever shone before.
Faster winds bring greater fallen and greater lies.
Mistakes are human after all, it will be different next time.
Not tomorrow but one day, these delusions drown away.
Surrendering control, the fallen are born, the cruel persist their charades, fanticizing a crown.
Lifetimes gutter out, the stars never cared
Sailing forever towards an unachievable goal
The biggest lie we ever told each other was that we were in control.
